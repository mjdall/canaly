# canaly
Colour Analyser for videos. The idea is to take a video, cluster the colours on a frame by frame basis and then cluster the clustered frames.
The end goal is to be able to extract the core colour themes from a video.
See `canaly.ipynb` for results.

# Requirements (Needs expanding)
Requires the [Big Buck Bunny video](https://download.blender.org/peach/bigbuckbunny_movies/) to run the note book.
Download and save as `test_videos/BigBuckBunny.mp4`.

# TODO
* Label frames with their colour clusters
* Use a frequent item set algorithm to find the strongest frequent item sets
* Validate frequent items
* Write a proper readme
